# What?
I am on an adventure with the SAS programming language

## This?
This repository is an attempt to document stuff that I read and learn on my SAS journey

## Visit
Ugly and not documented!
- [A dump of all things encountered](./learn.sas)
- [Deleting all macros](./delete_all_macros.sas)
- [Perform stratified sampling](./cars_stratified_sampling.sas)

## Und?

## Prettifying
SAS code looks horrible in the pr-installed SAS software. There are some nice SAS extesions. One I specifically like is `77qingliu.sas-syntax` extension on VS-Code. Although it is good -- especially if you set the bar as low as SAS does ðŸ™„, _cf._ their VS-Code extension `SAS.sas-lsp` -- I am adding modifications to the aforementioned extension. 

I would also like to develop in this repository:
- a proper linter
- an opinionated code-formatter
- better auto-complete capability 
- and an ability to convert comment text to a document (markdown is the target candidate)

The _WIP_ repository for that is at --> `https://github.com/bhatt-keshav/pretty-sas`
